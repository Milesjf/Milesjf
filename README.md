- 👋 Hi, I’m @Milesjf (Miles!)
- 👀 I’m interested in how code can improve my life, both at work and at home.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything as I'm new and wouldn't be any use to any projects right now!
- 📫 You're best off contacting me on Github as I avoid most social media.
